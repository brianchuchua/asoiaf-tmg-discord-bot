## Issues

To report issues (out of date or missing cards, typos, or any other bugs), please go to the Issues tab and click "New issue".

## Development

If I get hit by a bus or something, you can take over this project by:

- Forking it into your own repository
- Creating your own bot on Discord via https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot
- Go to the OAuth2 section, General, create a random redirect url (it's required but not used anywhere)
- Go to URL Generator, check "Bot", then check "Read Messages/View Channels" and "Send Messages"
- Click Copy to copy the URL and use it to add the bot to your server
- For running locally, clone .env.sample as .env and set the value of DISCORD_TOKEN to your Discord token (double-quotes around it) -- note that you use `!d` for local commands instead of `!a`.
- For running on the cloud, just ensure DISCORD_TOKEN is set to your bot's token in your cloud provider's environment variables
- Even non-coders can update the data pretty easily -- it's in the src/asoiaf folder and broken up logically by faction and card type.

### Updating Images

- If you update an existing image URL with a new file, also update IMAGE_CACHE_SUFFIX to be the date of the change to ensure the cache is cleared.
